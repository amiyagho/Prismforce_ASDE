# Abhimanyu in Chakravyuha 
Overview
This project contains a simple algorithm to determine whether Abhimanyu can successfully cross all 11 circles of the Chakravyuha in the Mahabharata. The algorithm simulates Abhimanyu's journey through the circles, each guarded by an enemy with a certain power level. Abhimanyu can skip some battles and recharge his power a limited number of times. The goal is to determine if Abhimanyu can reach the Pandava's army by crossing all the circles.

Problem Statement
Given:-

11 circles, each guarded by an enemy with a specific power level.
Abhimanyu starts with an initial power p.
Abhimanyu can skip a battle.
Abhimanyu can recharge his power b times.
Some enemies (in circles 3 and 7) have the ability to regenerate once with half of their initial power.
The algorithm checks if Abhimanyu can cross all the circles without his power dropping below the power of any enemy he encounters.
